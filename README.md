# Wall_Defect_Detection_YOLOv9
Construction industry plays an important role in 
overall economic development of the country.  Building 
infrastructure occupies a huge part of it. Ensuring the building 
safety and enhancing the quality of structure is a crucial thing 
for maintaining a good structural health of buildings. The 
traditional method, to detect the defects in buildings, uses 
manual inspection, but is very time-consuming and can also lead 
to human errors.  To address these issues, an automated defect 
detection model is developed using deep learning techniques 
based on You Only Look Once (YOLOv9) object detection 
algorithm. Additionally, the system is designed to be versatile as 
it identifies defects such as cracks, water seepage, mold, peeling 
paint and stairstep cracks. Notably, our model got the highest 
precision, recall and mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96.4%, 
96.9% and 98.7% respectively for the class crack. This model is 
useful for early defect prevention as many issues can increase 
rapidly if left untreated. The automated system has the quality 
to improve inspection efficiency and reduce maintenance costs. 
It also promotes smarter and safer solutions to decrease the 
unseen risks.
